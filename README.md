## Course Description

Explores stacks, queues, lists, vectors, hash tables, graphs, trees and algorithms including sorting, searching, iterating over data structures and recursion. Prerequisite: CS 162.

## Intended Outcomes for the Course

Upon successful completion students should be able to:

· Use an understanding of cultural differences in user populations and global software design requirements in order to design effective software.
· Employ good software engineering practices and good software design, always applying Software Engineering Code of Ethics as determined by
Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).
· Employ a deep knowledge of various data structures when constructing a program.
· Design and construct simple object-oriented software with an appreciation for data abstraction and information hiding.
· Effectively use software development tools including libraries, compilers, editors, linkers and debuggers to write and troubleshoot programs.

## Course Content (Themes, Concepts, Issues and Skills)

### Data Structures
  · doubly linked lists
  · queues (including array based and linked list based implementations)
  · stacks (including array based and linked list based implementations)
  · hash tables (including open addressing and chaining)
  · binary search trees
  · balanced trees (such as 2-3, 2-3-4, or red-black trees)
  · heaps and priority queues
  · graphs (including depth-first and breadth-first algorithms)
### Sorting Algorithms
  · basic algorithms such as selection, insertion, and bubble sort
  · advanced algorithms such as quick sort, merge sort
  · radix sort
### Analysis
  · determine a rough estimate of computational complexity using big-O notation
    C++ Standard Library
  · list, stack, queue containers
  · iterators
