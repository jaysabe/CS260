Online lab

Start with the code in ~mike.noel/classes/cs260/students/onlinelabs/lab04. You
will want to copy it into a directory of your own. 

The file supplied.o contains code
that can build, display, and destroy a binary search tree.

For this exam, you will need to write the following functions in table.cpp,
and add function prototypes for them to table.h and invoke the functions in
main.cpp.

* int countNodes(node * root)

  Recursively count the number of the nodes in the tree.

* int sumLeaves(node * root)

  Recursively sum all of the leaf nodes in the tree.

You must use the functions with these exact function prototypes. Use the
supplied makefile for the project to build it. Please don't forget the
supplied.o when generating the executable.

Run your program in valgrind and make sure there are no memory errors or
memory leaks. Assuming the executable file is named app

     valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full ./app

For lab04 submission, create a tar file containing table.cpp, table.h, and
main.cpp. Use the turnin command to submit it.

     tar cvf lab04_files.tar main.cpp list.cpp list.h
     ~mike.noel/bin/turnin cs260 lab04_files.tar

If you do not turn in ALL of your source files or if I'm unable to compile the
code you submit then you will receive a very low score.

The grading criteria are:

5pts The program compiles
3pts The program runs without crashing or hanging
2pts No memory errors or memory leaks
5pts Correct functionality (2pts for countNodes, 3pts for sumLeaves)
5pts Recursive implementation (2pts for countNodes, 3pts for sumLeaves)

You can get partial credit so be sure to turn in whatever you have by the end
of the lab period.
